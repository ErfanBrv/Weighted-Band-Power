# Weighted-Bandpower-Implementation
This reposity aims at implementing WBP introduced in following paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0041624X2030069X 

WBP enhances the quality of bandpower computation for defects with relative thickness more than 90 percent through giving more weight to those
scan points placed fruther away than pizoelecteric. 

The data used in the code can not be shared.
